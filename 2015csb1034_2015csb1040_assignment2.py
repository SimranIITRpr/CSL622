the blue histogram showsthe distribution of edges with different 
edge betweenness centralities.The maximum number of edges are with
 the centrality between 0.003 to 0.005. There are very less edges with
 high centrality and these edges are the weak ties. Now we have plotted 
 with the red line the edge centrality of the longest shortest path(diameter).
These edges lie in the high centrality region.
Observation: the diameter of the connected graph comprises of weak ties.
